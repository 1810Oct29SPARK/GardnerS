Spark Project Proposal

Theme:
    Famous Painters

API:
    Wikipedia

Example:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=categories%7Cimages&titles=Caravaggio
    This will grab the JSON of Carvaggio. It also shows links to images within the article and the catagories it belongs to.
    The Categories thing is because I want to use other Renaissance painters and randomly select them.

Use Cases:
x    You can sign up for an email about painters.
x    You can search for different painters and view their art.
-    You can select a random painter and have their art show up.
-    You can look at paintings by century or decade or something.
?    You can login and then have a history of the paintings you like.
?    You can like paintings.
x    You can view history of the painter.
-    You can view history of the time the painting was made in.
x    You can click a link to a printshop website.
?    What art style it came from.
-    How the painting was accomplished.

API endpoints:
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/ + "file-name" to get back images.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=images%7Cextracts&titles=Fan_Kuan&exchars=1000&exintro=1
        What about if people fuck up the name and put a typo in? I don't know how to do that.
        In order to remove pronunciation stuffs I should get rid of information between (parentheses).
    Instead I'll make sure that the home page is populated from a list of default artists. They'll be randomly selected. Like 20 artists.
    https://www.allposters.com/gallery?txtSearch=The+Musicians
    This is the website for checking your prints.
    artsy API will give me more functionality.
        it has pics and similar artists, something wiki cant give me.
    https://developers.artsy.net/start?id=5be440517bd621002be6eaac
    https://api.artsy.net/api/artists/patrick-nagel
    from the data above grab "image", image will need you to pass in a value from image_version.
    I prefer Large.

    som stuff to consider
    onpageload generate artist. if it fails have some saved stuff i like.
    header and search bar that go away on scroll but a persistent nav bar.
    footer links to stuff.
    4 pages eh home explore artists acknowledgements something else.
    home page has a link to sign up for a weekly email about some artist.
    format, flexbox of art and artist info so it can be big or small.
    artist name
    artist description
    additional links

    question, function vs local scope.   
    fucntiopn scope vs local
    local language dependent
    method scope
    java is only single quotes

    problems, can't have impracise entries in search
    can't figure out good other pages,
    I have two pages of nothingness.
    sanitizing user input
    invalid name for them.
    make it look nice when an error occurs.
