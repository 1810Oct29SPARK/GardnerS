Spark Project Proposal

Theme:
    Famous Painters (Maybe Renaissance)

API:
    Wikipedia

Example:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=categories%7Cimages&titles=Caravaggio
    This will grab the JSON of Carvaggio. It also shows links to images within the article and the catagories it belongs to.
    The Categories thing is because I want to use other Renaissance painters and randomly select them.

Use Cases:
x    You can sign up for an email about painters.
x    You can search for different painters and view their art.
-    You can select a random painter and have their art show up.
-    You can look at paintings by century or decade or something.
?    You can login and then have a history of the paintings you like.
?    You can like paintings.
x    You can view history of the painter.
-    You can view history of the time the painting was made in.
x    You can click a link to a printshop website.
?    What art style it came from.
-    How the painting was accomplished.

API endpoints:
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/ + "file-name" to get back images.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=images%7Cextracts&titles=Fan_Kuan&exchars=1000&exintro=1
        What about if people fuck up the name and put a typo in? I don't know how to do that.
        In order to remove pronunciation stuffs I should get rid of information between (parentheses).
    Instead I'll make sure that the home page is populated from a list of default artists. They'll be randomly selected. Like 20 artists.
    https://www.allposters.com/gallery?txtSearch=The+Musicians
    This is the website for checking your prints.
    artsy API will give me more functionality.
        it has pics and similar artists, something wiki cant give me.
    https://developers.artsy.net/start?id=5be440517bd621002be6eaac
    https://api.artsy.net/api/artists/patrick-nagel
    from the data above grab "image", image will need you to pass in a value from image_version.
    I prefer Large.
