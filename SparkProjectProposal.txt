Theme:
    Famous Painters (Maybe Renaissance)

API:
    Wikipedia

Example:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=categories%7Cimages&titles=Caravaggio
    This will grab the JSON of Carvaggio. It also shows links to images within the article and the catagories it belongs to.
    The Categories thing is because I want to use other Renaissance painters and randomly select them.

    You can sign up for an email about painters.
    You can search for different painters and view their art.
    You can select a random painter and have their art show up.

    You can like paintings.
